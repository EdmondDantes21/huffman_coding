# Parallel Closest pair of points
This repository contains all the material used for carrying out the high performance computing for data science project. The course is given by professor Francesco Fiore during the second semester of 2023 at the university of Trento.

The closest pair problem is a fundamental problem in computational geometry that consists in identifying the closest pair of points among a very large dataset of ùëÅ points.
This project focuses on the parallelization of the most common techniques through OpenMP and MPI. The methodologies under consideration include the naive solution and the divide-et-impera approach.
